# Git Worktree Quick Start

This project is now set up as a git repository with worktree support!

## What You Have Now

- âœ“ Git repository initialized on `main` branch
- âœ“ 2 commits with full project history
- âœ“ All sensitive files protected (.gitignore configured)
- âœ“ Professional folder structure
- âœ“ Comprehensive documentation

## Next Steps: Start Using Worktrees

### Option 1: Keep Current Directory, Add Worktrees as Needed

Stay in the current directory and create worktrees when you need them:

```bash
# Create a feature worktree
git worktree add ../rds_databricks_claude-feature feature/my-feature

# Work in the new worktree
cd ../rds_databricks_claude-feature
# ... make changes ...
git add .
git commit -m "Feature changes"

# Go back to main
cd ../rds_databricks_claude
git merge feature/my-feature
```

### Option 2: Reorganize for Full Worktree Workflow (Recommended)

Rename the current directory to be explicit about the branch:

```bash
# From parent directory
cd /Users/danerosa
mv rds_databricks_claude rds_databricks_claude-main

# Now create additional worktrees
cd rds_databricks_claude-main
git worktree add ../rds_databricks_claude-feature feature/dlt-migration
git worktree add ../rds_databricks_claude-test feature/testing

# List all worktrees
git worktree list
```

## Common Commands

```bash
# Create new worktree with new branch
git worktree add -b <branch-name> ../<worktree-directory-name>

# List all worktrees
git worktree list

# Remove a worktree
git worktree remove ../<worktree-directory-name>

# Clean up deleted worktrees
git worktree prune
```

## Example: DLT Migration Workflow

```bash
# Create worktrees for different work streams
git worktree add -b feature/dlt-pipeline ../rds_databricks_claude-pipeline
git worktree add -b feature/validation ../rds_databricks_claude-validation

# Open Terminal 1: Pipeline development
cd ../rds_databricks_claude-pipeline
# Edit scripts/pipeline/dlt_fde_pipeline.py

# Open Terminal 2: Run validation
cd ../rds_databricks_claude-validation
python scripts/validation/check_table_stats.py

# Both work in parallel!
```

## Full Documentation

See [docs/GIT_WORKTREE_WORKFLOW.md](docs/GIT_WORKTREE_WORKFLOW.md) for complete guide.

## Benefits

- ðŸ”„ Work on multiple features simultaneously
- ðŸš€ No context switching (git checkout)
- ðŸ§ª Run tests in one worktree while developing in another
- ðŸ‘€ Compare implementations side-by-side
- ðŸ’¾ Each worktree keeps its own state (editor, terminal, etc.)
