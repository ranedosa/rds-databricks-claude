- `results/` (output data)
- `venv/` (virtual environment)

### 5. Comprehensive Documentation
- **README.md** - Main project documentation
- **docs/DAILY_WORKFLOW.md** - Daily branch management guide

- **config/README.md** - Configuration setup instructions

## üöÄ How to Use

### Every Day - Start Your Work

**In Claude Code:**
```
/start-work
```

**Or in terminal:**
```bash
./start-day.sh
```

This will:
1. Check your current branch
2. Ask what you want to work on today
3. Help you create a new feature branch or switch to existing work
4. Verify your setup before you start

### Your First Feature Branch

Let's try it now! Create your first feature branch:

```bash
# Create a feature worktree
git worktree add -b feature/test-worktree ../rds_databricks_claude-test

# Switch to it
cd ../rds_databricks_claude-test

# Verify
git branch --show-current
# Should show: feature/test-worktree

# When done, go back and clean up
cd /Users/danerosa/rds_databricks_claude
git worktree remove ../rds_databricks_claude-test
git branch -d feature/test-worktree
```

## üìã Daily Workflow

### Morning Routine
1. Open Claude Code in your project directory
2. Type `/start-work`
3. Follow the prompts to select or create a branch
4. Start coding!

### During the Day
- Commit frequently: `git add . && git commit -m "Clear message"`
- Push your branch: `git push origin feature/your-feature`
- Work in parallel using multiple worktrees if needed

### End of Day
- Commit all changes
- Push to remote for backup
- Note which branch you're on for tomorrow

## üéØ Key Commands

### Claude Code Slash Commands
```
/start-work          - Start your daily work (checks branch, creates new if needed)
```

### Git Worktree Commands
```bash
# Create new feature worktree
git worktree add -b feature/name ../rds_databricks_claude-shortname

# List all worktrees
git worktree list

# Remove worktree
git worktree remove ../rds_databricks_claude-shortname

# Switch to worktree (just cd)
cd ../rds_databricks_claude-shortname
```

### Daily Helper Script
```bash
./start-day.sh       - Interactive branch selection menu
```

## üìö Documentation

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| [README.md](README.md) | Main project documentation |
| [docs/DAILY_WORKFLOW.md](docs/DAILY_WORKFLOW.md) | **Read this first** - Daily branch management |

## üîê Security Reminders

Before you commit anything:
- ‚úì `config/` is gitignored (contains credentials)
- ‚úì `.env` and `.databrickscfg` are gitignored
- ‚úì Large data files are gitignored
- ‚úì Always check `git status` before committing
- ‚úì Never commit API tokens or passwords

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Use `/start-work` daily** - It ensures you're always on the right branch
2. **Create worktrees for parallel work** - Edit code in one, run tests in another
3. **Name branches descriptively** - `feature/dlt-migration` not `feature/new-stuff`
4. **Commit frequently** - Small, focused commits are better than large ones
5. **Push your branches** - Backup your work to remote regularly

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "I forgot to create a feature branch"
```bash
# Create branch from your current work
git checkout -b feature/my-feature
# Now you're on a feature branch with all your changes
```

### "Which branch am I on?"
```bash
git branch --show-current
```

### "Where are all my worktrees?"
```bash
git worktree list
```

### "I need help!"
- Read: `docs/DAILY_WORKFLOW.md`
- Run: `./start-day.sh`
- Ask: Type `/start-work` in Claude Code
