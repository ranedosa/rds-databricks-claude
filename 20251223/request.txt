Hi can I Get count of active properties, companies with active properties, and sum of units:

answer: 
%sql
SELECT
    COUNT(DISTINCT p.id) as active_properties,
    COUNT(DISTINCT p.company_id) as companies_with_active_properties,    
    SUM(p.unit) as total_units
    FROM rds.pg_rds_public.properties p
    WHERE p.status = 'ACTIVE';

follow up: 
Can we Exclude from the query:
- IDV Only properties (duplicate properties on the platform)
- Other partner properties not listed on the Customer Log
- Test/demo properties that are listed as active
Buildings that are phased out (123 Main St Phase 1, 123 Main St Phase 2)
