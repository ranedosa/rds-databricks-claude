description: Generates a detailed summary of the current session.

Please act as a senior developer reviewing my work. Based on the entire conversation transcript, generate a concise session summary in Markdown format. The summary should include:

- **Objective**: What was the primary goal of this session?
- **Work Completed**: A bulleted list of tasks finished, files created, or bugs fixed.
- **Key Decisions**: Any important architectural choices or trade-offs made.
- **Current State**: What is the current status of the work? What's left undone or broken?
- **Next Steps**: A clear, actionable list of what needs to be done next to continue this work.
- **Critical File Locations**: A list of the most important files that were modified or discussed.

The output should be clean, well-structured Markdown, ready to be saved to a file. Do not include any conversational text outside of the summary itself.
