üîç KEY FINDINGS:

The table has a ROW FILTER that automatically filters out rows where
_fivetran_deleted = true. This is causing your "missing data" issue.

üìä WHAT HAPPENED:

1. Before Oct 13: You had many visible rows (check version 22755 count)
2. Oct 13: Fivetran synced deletions from PostgreSQL, marking rows as deleted
3. After Oct 13: The row filter hides these deleted rows automatically
4. Today: You only see 1 active row (the rest are filtered out)

‚úÖ SOLUTIONS:

Option 1 - RESTORE DATA IN POSTGRESQL:
   If the deletions were accidental, restore the records in your source
   PostgreSQL database. Fivetran will automatically sync them back and
   mark them as active again.

Option 2 - VIEW HISTORICAL DATA (Time Travel):
   Query a version before the deletions:
   SELECT * FROM {table_name} VERSION AS OF 22755

Option 3 - TEMPORARILY DISABLE ROW FILTER:
   To see all data including deleted rows:
   ALTER TABLE {table_name} DROP ROW FILTER;

   ‚ö†Ô∏è  WARNING: This will expose deleted records to ALL queries!

Option 4 - QUERY WITH EXPLICIT FILTER:
   Include the filter explicitly in your WHERE clause to understand
   which records are deleted:
   SELECT *, _fivetran_deleted FROM {table_name} VERSION AS OF 24189
